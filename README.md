# OptiMiser üéØ


## Basic Details
### Individual: Anjali Tinu - Model Engineering College


### Project Description
A chatbot that takes perfectly normal code and turns it into a messy, convoluted, CPU-burning monstrosity without breaking it. Because simple is overrated.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many developers are writing clean, readable code. Where‚Äôs the fun in that? There's no thrill, no drama, no unnecessary recursion.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I built OptiMiser, a chaos-loving chatbot that ‚Äúoptimizes‚Äù your code by making it longer, slower, and just plain weird but still technically correct. Because why not?

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
- Libraries used: Fetch API for talking to Groq, Llama3 (via Groq API) for absurd logic
- Tools used: VS Code, Groq API
